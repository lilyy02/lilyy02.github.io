        Upon visiting the site, my attention was immediately caught by an
        animated loading screen. Bold green capital lettering in a sans serif
        font was centred in my view, with elipses gradually appearing which
        functioned as a progress bar. Images of different figures also moved
        across the screen, maintaining my attention as the webpage loaded.

      />
    </div>
    <p class="para2">
      I spent the next two minutes scrolling through the website, being
      intrigued by all the different animations and transitions between the
      sections. After I had reached the bottom of the page I returned back to
      top of the webpage where earlier I had noticed some buttons/links in a
      horizontal menu. These jumped towards their respective headings on the
      site which were shown in order as you scrolled. While it was nice to
      quickly jump to each section, I couldnt find an easy way to quickly jump
      back to the top of the page where the menu was located.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      After doing this I spent some time viewing the page in different size
      windows, observing that the page adjusted to fit the elements on my
      screen, however they were not always the same size relative to each other,
      such as the speech bubbles scaling to be larger relative the rest of the
      page compared to when I had the window set to fullscreen, 1920x1080. As
      well as this, I also noticed that the menu dissapeared when the window
      size was reduced, along with the rubbish that the janitor was seen
      sweeping up as I scrolled through with a larger browser window.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      When interacting with this experience I spent the most time engaging with
      the single-scroll design of the site, intrigued by how each section was
      presented in a visually distinct manner despite while still being on the
      same page. They visual design and animated transtions between each topic
      covered definitely made the experience more interesting. I found that my
      most common action in the two minutes I spent interacting with the web
      experience was scrolling back and forth to view these animations.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      Based on the information present, I gathered that the primary goal of this
      interactive experience was to show apprecitation for janitorial work as
      well as aim to alter public perception toward the profession to be more
      positive. It communicates this primary goal through brief facts and images
      on the history of the janitor profession. As well as this, the webpage
      raises rhetorical questions to highlight the importance of the role, such
      as in the heading "What would happen to the planet without the wiper"
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      I dont believe that this experience should be interacted with on a
      frequent basis, serving more as a sort of infographic to raise awareness
      on the importance of janitorial work. I beleive that the web experience is
      designed to be interacted with only a few times, enough to absorb the
      information. Rather, I think that it is meant to be shared to others so
      the message reaches more people. Since the information seems quick and
      easy to digest for the average person, without going too far into depth,
      it communicates that it is more of a one-time experience that someone
      might spend a bit reading about and consider the viewpoints proposed
      within. It seems intended to prompt more thought about the value of all
      jobs towards maintaining a functioning society.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      The experience references traditional print forms of media such as
      newspapers, photographs and paintings. The site is styled similar in a way
      to a scrapbook, with images resembling clippings from old halftone-printed
      sources with many also being in black and white. The vintage look to these
      images plays into the idea that in the past janitors were respected for
      their work. I believe that the references to more traditional forms of
      media make the experience (and in turn the arguments given by the webpage)
      feel more grounded in reality, and referencing these as a stylistic choice
      can make it seem more notable and play on ideas and concepts already
      familiar to a target audience. These will be ideas I may implement in my
      own design work in the future. These references also communicate to me a
      sense of nostalgia for an idealised past, which is somewhat presented by
      in the sections titled "but that's changed now" and "but that wasn't
      always the case".
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      The most frustrating part of the experience was probably the lack of
      having an easy way to navigate to the different sections after you had
      already scrolled too far, given that the menu was only at the top of the
      page and not constantly present. As well as this it seems in smalled
      window sizes this menu isn't present at all. I also found that some of the
      points given, such as the example of famous people being janitors and them
      having been the subject of painting are weak arguments for what I believed
      this interactive experience's purpose was in inproving common perception
      of janitors. On the other hand, I found the site to be very well designed
      in terms of visuals, with the stylistic choices resembling a scrapbook and
      print media appealing. The animated transitions between different sections
      were very engaging, and the single-scroll design gave it a nice modern feel contrary to the vintage style images and made reading it feel smooth and uninterrupted.
