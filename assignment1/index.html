    <h2>This is a review of the interactive web project "The Man Whose Work We Don't Notice" - available at https://brooomstick.com/</h2>
    <p>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
      2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.

  <p>The first thing that caught my attention when interacting with this web experience was the large, bold font and capitalisation of the heading, featuring the phrase "the man whose work we don't notice". The position of the text also helped catch my attention, being in the centre of my view. </p>
  <p>As I scrolled through the site, a silhouette of a person moves across the screen, sweeping up the the rubbish. I noticed that the texture of a person resembled that which is used to show transparency in digital images, a nice touch playing on the idea of janitorial work beeing unseen and unnoticed. Another notable design choice was the negative comments coming from the other figures dissapearing as the janitor did their job.</p>
  <p>I continued to scroll further down </p>
