  <p class ="para1">Upon visiting the site, my attention was <br> immediately caught by an animated loading <br>screen. Bold green capital lettering in a sans serif <br> font was centred in my view, with elipses gradually <br>appearing which functioned as a progress bar. <br>Images of different figures also moved across the <br>screen, maintaining my attention as the webpage <br>loaded. </p>
