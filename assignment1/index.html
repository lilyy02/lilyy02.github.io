      This is a review of the interactive web project "The Man Whose Work We
      Don't Notice" - available at

        Upon visiting the site, my attention was
        immediately caught by an animated loading screen. Bold green
        capital lettering in a sans serif
        font was centred in my view, with elipses gradually appearing
        which functioned as a progress bar. Images of different figures
        also moved across the screen, maintaining my attention as the
        webpage loaded.
